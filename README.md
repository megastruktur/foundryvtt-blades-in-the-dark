# FoundryVTT Beam Saber character and Squad sheets
-- Forked by Grankless to merge system compatibility fixes; I do not have any coding expertise so do not expect future development unless this is forked again --

This game system is for  Beamsaber (v0.55) by Austin Ramsay which can be found here - https://austin-ramsay.itch.io/beamsaber
Everything is based off the Blades in the Dark system from megastruktur - https://github.com/megastruktur/foundryvtt-blades-in-the-dark

The system has custom character sheets supporting Pilot and Vehicle Stats and abilities and Squad sheets for the group supporting the new currency.

## Usage
